		<img src='../images/graph1.png' alt = 'bar plot average temperature by month'width='500' height='400'>
	<h3>Analysis:</h3>
	<p><strong>Madison, Wisconsin's </strong>weather visualized by daily average temperature. Average calculated by month. Through years 1869-2023 </p>
	<h3>Other Applicable Methods:</h3>
	<p>The first graph gives a good idea of what the average temerature was by month overall throughout the entire date span listed. What if we want to see some trends by period and compare and contrasting time periods and not averaging them together. </p>
	<h2>Madison Weather Trends, 1983-2023 Vertically Graphed by Year Decade</h2>
	<h3>Visual 2</h3>
	<img src='../images/graph2.png' alt = 'smooth line plot, each line being averages from each decade by month, and an additional "other" decade catagory'width ='500' height ='400'>
	<h3>Analysis:</h3>
	<p>As the decade gets nearer to present day, the average tempreature rises. Also note the 'other' line, as it is the average for the rest of the dates not accounted for in the four decades highlighted, 1869-1982 </p>
