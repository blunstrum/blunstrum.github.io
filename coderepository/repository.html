 <h1>Code Repository: Code Snipets by Data</h1>
 <h2>Graph 1 Code</h2>
 <img src='../images/code1.png' alt = 'code snipet explaining how to code graph 1'width = '900' height = '300'>
 <h3>Code explanation:</h3>
 <p>A cvs file was first loaded into the 'weather' variable, and subsequent data transformations were preformed to tidy the data to how is was needed.</p>
 <h2>Graph 2 Code:</h2>
 <img src='../images/code2.png' alt = 'code snipet explaining how to code graph 2'width = '900' height = '300'>
 <h3>Code explanation:</h3>
 <p>The dataset was first filtered by 40 year period with case_when function. This filtering was to seperate the data rows by the four most recent decades. Note the 'other' filtering value, as all dates before were added to that line's average. Subsequent grouping and summarizing follows to tidy data. ggplot was used to create the visual.</p>

<h2>Top 5 temp code:</h2>
<img src='../images/code3.png' alt = 'code snipet showing code to get top five temp list'width = '300' height = '500'>
<h3>Code explanation</h3>
<p>All dates and temps were extracted from the data set as pairs. A slice max function was used to grab the top five rows, using the max temp variable to compare.</p>
