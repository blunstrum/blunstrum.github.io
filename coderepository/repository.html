 <h3>Code explanation:</h3>
 <p>A cvs file was first loaded into the 'weather' variable, and subsequent data transformations were preformed to tidy the data to how is was needed.</p>
 <h2>Graph 2 Code:</h2>

 <h3>Code explanation:</h3>
 <p>The dataset was first filtered by 40 year period with case_when function. This filtering was to seperate the data rows by the four most recent decades. Note the 'other' filtering value, as all dates before were added to that line's average. Subsequent grouping and summarizing follows to tidy data. ggplot was used to create the visual.</p>
